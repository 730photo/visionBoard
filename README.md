<h3># visionBoard<br>

For project #3, I created a simple app where you can pick your ideal starting lineup in the NBA. 

And yes, all photography is by me.


-once the player comes to the site they are taken to the landing page where there is a Login button.

-Once the rhey click the Login button they will be taken to user list where they can delete a user or update a users name.

-when they click on a users name, they will be taken to the vision board page where you will see their ideal starting 5, if there is nothing there they can click the gallery button and select the players from the gallery.
